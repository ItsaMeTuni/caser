# Documentation

Caser is split in three crates (i.e. modules):
- [Server](./server): self-explanatory.
- [Client](./client): a Rust library to interact with the server (i.e for making requests to a Caser server).
- [Common](./common): code that is shared between the client and the server (mainly data structures).

Quick links:
- [Resources](./resources.md): documentation on the API's routes and objects.
- [Intro to RRULE](./rrule-intro.md): a quick introduction to the RFC 5545's RRULE, used to describe event recurrence patterns.
